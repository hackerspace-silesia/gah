                        U: Yes, I am all ears. <br>
                        CO: Check zone I and II. 2 reports confirmed. Your main objective is to transport the wounded to the hospital. Time's the essence. Over and out!<br>
                        M: Confirmed, over!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        U: I've got new order. Zone I and II got at least 2 reports of wounded. Main aim is to pick them up, provide medical attention and safety transport. How's the situation out there?

                    <p>
                        LA: Street X / Y is impassable, sniper activity reported in the vicinity of mosque. Center areas are still heavily patrolled. U: I've updated my map accordingly. Do I need to know anything specific about Afghans culture? LA: Do not: interupt nor walk in front of praying people. Never point fingers, be a humble man when you approach local citizens. You shouldn't be nervous and when it comes to clothing  - refrain from wearing shorts. I advise you use greeting "Salam Aleikum" and answering it with "Aleikum Salam". U: Is that all? LA: Unless you need a reminder of safety policy
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        U: I could use a review LA: Sure. First - you are in the foreign land. Be aware of the surroundings. Remember that we operate in a high risk zones. Any early warning or information about threat can determine death or life outcome. That is why in car always drive with your window open or try to reach out to local informators for tips about covers and safe routes. Avoid knowns sniper areas yet if you happen to be under fire move faster to lower the chance to be hit. Never attempt to move mines. Don't leave the main roads. Think ahead. Keep calm at all situation. Don't forget your ID. Never try to run away from soliders. Use modest body language. Try to understand local culture. If you find yourself in a building do not try to show yourself out
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        T: "Salam Aleikum" U: "Aleikum Salam" <br>
                        T: What you want here? U: I have wounded people with me. I am a doctor, want to help. We are on our way to hospital in the eastern parts of the city. T: We check you for weapons. You hide rebels, you hide weapons, you die.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        U: I got 2 frome zone I and II with me in stable conditions. They need fresh bandages and cleanse of their wounds <br>
                        CO: Bring them to room 3. We got some unstable patients in room 2 that needs more medical attention, please go forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        N: Congratulations. You have made it. Road wasn't simple. There were many rules to follow. Please understand that one mistake can make a difference between life and death. Not only yours but people that go with you or people that u cannot reach you way to when you take safety policy too lightly. To work in the high stress area you need to developt an attitude of looking always behind your back, be aware of your surrondings, knowing a local culture and following good informations. Safety first!
